👋 Hello! I am Ryan. I am usually referred to as @DeltaVar online.  \
=> More about myself  \
I am 17 years old this year, a Singaporean &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ec; and an aspiring pilot🧑‍✈️currently specializing in the Aerospace Engineering Major.  \
I have had 4 years of developing experiences with many popular clients. I always prefer to charge way cheaper than usual just to gain experience and help out beginner project starters.  \
  \
=> 🛠️ Developer Specialization  \
Discord Bot Development [ Experienced ]  \
Roblox Game Production & Management [ Full-Stack ]  \
Web Programming [ Intermediate ]  \
Databases (mySQL, Firebase) [ Experienced ]  \
  \
=> 📝 Resume  \
Due to to nature of all the studios/clients I have worked for, a NDA was mandatory. Hence, I will not be able to show any work  \
besides my own projects. I understand that this may result in distrust, but client confidentiality comes first.  \
